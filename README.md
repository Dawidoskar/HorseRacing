# HorseRacing
Hi,

is nice to see you here!
This repository is not finished. Soon you will find here more files according to Horse Racing.

Why this topic? 
Because I wrote Master Thesis in R about Horse Racing Modeling. 
Now to develop my Python skill I try to rewrite this code to Python, and add a few new futures.
I like to take a pictures on horse racing, so there is a lot of fun for me to collect and analyse this data!
